      The College Tech Club is a community of curious and creative minds passionate about technology,
      innovation, coding, and futuristic learning. Our mission is to help students sharpen skills,
      explore new technologies, build real-world projects, and collaborate with like-minded developers.
      From workshops to hackathons, seminars to hands-on project building, we provide opportunities that
      help students learn and grow beyond the classroom. Beginners and experts — everyone is welcome!
